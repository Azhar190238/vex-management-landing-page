      "I have been working with Derrik for a few years, and it's been an absolute game changer for my business. I had been in business for 10+ yrs before working with Hone Coach. I felt like I had hit a wall and couldn't grow anymore. Derrik taught me the importance of 'knowing my numbers'.",

      "I've spoken with several consultants, business owners and professionals and Derrik and Hone Coach has been by far the most helpful. He is very open and honest and as detailed or high level as needed with every question and concern. He's saved me time and money and foresaw potential issues that others didn't even think of.",

      "I've just started with Hone Coach and I'm really excited about it. They have me moving in a thoughtful direction. They're helping me understand things about my business I haven't paid attention to and it's going to help make smarter moves this year. The biggest advantage I've seen so far is the guidance to improve in way more phases then just selling more.",

      "Derrik has been a joy to work with. He cares and isn't just checking the boxes like most coaches. He works to understand what our business is and does for our customers. With that information, he's been helping us improve many aspects of our business to improve more than just our revenue. He's helping us create a better experience for our customers and team!",
